# react-native-bg-thread
This package helps in executing the javascript in a background thread. Time-consuming javascript code is shifted to a native background thread by freeing the main-UI thread, which helps in increasing the efficiency of the application.
Thread priority can be handled by passing in the appropriate flags. Currently we support three types of flag as under:
| Priority Flags      | Description | Android thread value     | IOS thread value     |
| :----:       |    :----:   |     :----: | :----: |
| MAX      | This sets the thread priority to the maximum available on the corresponding native platform.       | 10  | 1.0 |
| MIN   | This sets the thread priority to the minmimum available on the corresponding native platform.        | 1     | 0.1 |
| NORMAL   | This sets the thread priority to the default or normal on the corresponding native platform.        | 5     | 0.5 |
